          % Arabica is about my love for coffee, design, and seeing the world.
          My story begins in Tokyo, Japan. Being raised by parents who were
          enthusiasts of a universal language called ‘’Esperanto”, we would
          travel abroad every summer to attend a “World Esperanto Congress” held
          in different countries. My father was the owner of a manufacturing and
          trading company, and together with his frequent business trips, they
          would take me overseas whenever possible – ultimately helping to
          inspire my love of multiculturalism, design, and architecture. Through
          experiencing different cultures, seeing rich and poor people, happy
          and unhappy people, I started to wonder who I was, and asked myself
          what kind of life I wanted to live? After my high school graduation, I
          moved to California for college. I settled into a snug apartment in
          Venice Beach and indulged myself in the unique fusion of beach hippie
          culture. It was during my college years that my love for coffee
          started. In 1990’s, Starbucks began to expand throughout the country,
          capturing me with their new coffee culture and serene atmosphere. <br>,<br>
          I
          spent lots of my days at the Starbucks in Venice Beach, either talking
          with friends or studying. Upon graduating from college, I started work
          for a trading company, which allowed me to travel overseas for
          business. A lot was learned from working closely with business owners
          around the world; I gained valuable insights as per their mindset
          towards work and life. And although most of them were very wealthy, I
          found that some were happy and others were not. This caused me to keep
          asking the same two questions: Who am I? What kind of life do I want
          to live? I reflected on them over and over. Eventually, I found my
          answers. ・I want to live a simple and down-to-earth life. <br /> <br>
          ・I
          only need the basics to be satisfied: food, clothing and a house. ・As
          my parents did for me, I also want to travel with my children and
          provide a higher standard of life for them. And my last answer was
          coffee. I truly need an amazing cup of coffee every day. This is why I
          founded % Arabica. So to create the best coffee possible, I borrowed
          money and bought a coffee farm in Hawaii. I also started trading green
          beans from around the world and became the sole-exporter of a Japanese
          roasting machine along with the distributor of one of the best
          espresso machines in the world. Then in September 2014, I opened the
          flagship store in the beautiful historic city of Kyoto, Japan.
          <br>
          
          <br>
          Our dream is to grow % Arabica across unique lands and cultures
          of the world, so that we can “See the World Through Coffee.” We only
          live once, so let’s explore the world we live in, set goals, and enjoy
          our time together over an amazing cup of coffee.
