          Drinking coffee gives ‘special’ boost to the brain beyond effect
        </h4>

        <img src="/Blogcafe/img/blog2.jpg" alt="News" />

        <p>
          The boost people get from drinking a cup of coffee can’t be
          replicated with plain caffeine, reveals a new study that found
          additional areas of the brain activated by the hot beverage. Studies
          have shown how coffee – that millions across the world refuse to
          start their day without – makes people more alert. Researchers,
          including those from the University of Minho in Portugal, examined
          whether the wakefulness effect of coffee is dependent only on the
          properties of caffeine or if additional factors were at play. They
          found that plain caffeine only partially reproduced the effects of
          drinking a cup of coffee, according to the study, published recently
          in the journal Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience. While caffeine
          boosted areas of the brain that make one feel more alert, coffee
          brought additional effects on brain areas that affect working memory
          and goal-directed behaviour.

        <h4>Spare me the outrage over a £9 jar of coffee</h4>

        <img src="/Blogcafe/img/blog3.jpg" alt="News" />

        <p>
          Who is paying £9.25 for a big tub of instant coffee and why are they
          the worst person you know? The supermarket aisles of Morrissons were
          agog this week after a customer spotted a shelf hawking a 190g jar
          of Douwe Egberts coffee jar going for the eye-watering price of
          £9.25 — a rise of three quid, the customer complained, in just a
          matter of weeks. It is a full £3.25 cheaper in Asda compared to the
          Morrisons price. First you feel the pinch, then, in time, you feel
          nothing at all. To channel the swashbuckling spirit of Liz Truss,
          the pro-growth superbrain who surely shoulders much of the blame for
          this runaway inflation train, still rapidly disappearing off a very
          deep cliff, that is a disgrace. It stinks like a slice of Epoisse de
          Bourgogne. And don’t get me started on the scary price of dairy.
          Doyennes of the wider caffeine circles will note that this is not
          just any coffee. It is in fact “no ordinary jar, no ordinary
          coffee”, per the jaunty branding of the Dutch company, a heady blend
          of “260 years of coffee craft and knowledge”. So there you have it —
          not a rip off. The words of Marie Antoinette echo down the centuries
          as unwashed proles across these rainy isles complain that they can’t
          get their caffeine fix without striking their loo roll quotient from
          their weekly shopping list: “let them drink tea”. relief of
          withdrawal symptoms.
